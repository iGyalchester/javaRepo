    HashMap is literally just a list of  keys and values.
-- map(K - the type of keys maintained by this map, V - the type of mapped values)
    Keys cannot be repeated.

	in this case, we are mapping names to phone numbers.
	Map<String, String> phoneBook = new HashMap<>();

	printing individual key from map.
	sout(map.get(k/v));


	looping though and printing data in a Map:

	Set<K> keys = map.keySet();
	for(K key :keys){
	sout(key+ " " + map.get(key));
	}

	Another way to create HashMap
	HashMap example = new HashMap();
	example.put(k,v);

    replaciong in hashmap:
    sout(example.replace(k,v);
